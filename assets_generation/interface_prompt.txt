As a web designer, I want to create a frontend using html and css, with tailwind.
The purpose of the web app is to be a turn-based video-game, in a medieval fantasy setting.
The color scheme is in the zinc, brown and stone grey.
I want a page for the battle scene, with the player character on the left. 
The player character should have a big portrait representing its face, then have a vertical health bar to its right.
Below should be 4 circular progress bars for different actions with cooldowns.
Each monster should have a similar panel, with a portrait, health bar and 3 actions below. 
There should be 6 monster panels, in 2 columns.
The player panel should take the left half of the screen, and the monster panels the right half.
Generate the html and css for me.
