As a game illustrator, I want to draw a portrait of a medieval fantasy bat enemy, in a old-school hand draw style with few pastel colors.
The bat has dark wings and long teeth, with an angry mean face.
The picture should be taken from sufficiently far away so that we can see the whole wings.
Generate it for me.
