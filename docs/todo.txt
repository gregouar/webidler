Next things to do:

- crit blessing

- lightning always strikes twice: storm damage is lucky
- rapid toxins: double poison damage, half duration
- blazing fire: add a % chances to inflict fire dot on fire damage (cumul, short dur)
- overwhelming force: no crit chance, convert percent of crit damage to attack damage
- spread destruction: dot spread on enemy death

- failure chances stat effect
- threat damage passives
- spider boss & minions

- add at least basic attack/spell to all monsters to trigger retaliate effects?
  OR block dot?

=> find a way to combo multi skills/multi elements

- dual wield
- last login, activity log, etc
