Next things to do:

- add at least basic attack/spell to all monsters to trigger retaliate effects?
  OR block dot?

- failure chances stat effect
- market notification on sold item/ OR logs
- spider boss & minions

- conductive stun: storm damage is lucky on stunned enemy ? or just storm damage is lucky in general
- intense toxins: double poison damage, half duration
- burning fire: add a % chances to inflict fire dot on fire damage (cumul, short dur)
- overwhelming strikes: no crit chance, convert percent of crit damage to attack damage

=> find a way to combo multi skills/multi elements

- dual wield
- last login, activity log, etc
