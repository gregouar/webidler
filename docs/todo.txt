Next things to do:

- auto connect if jwt (and kicked out if expired, also kicked out of game instance if correct error)
- storm damage & utility tree (movement speed first?, then restoration power, status duration, life leech, mana cost?)
- market notification on sold item

- last login, activity log, etc
- dual wield
- spider boss & minions
